## Apartment Scraper
This project is an adaptation of my apartments-api written in Python. I'm currently learning Go and think it's a great lesson to translate an existing project. Currently, the application requires an Apartments.com URL as user input and returns the available units. I will build on this repo incrementally to be a fully functional API solution. This solution will eventually accept URLs from other providers like Zillow.com

### Usage

1. **Clone this repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnthonyBliss1/apts-go.git
```

2. **Run the application (Assuming Go is installed)**
```bash
go run apts.go
```

### If you want to try the executable (Go is not installed)

```bash 
./apts
```
